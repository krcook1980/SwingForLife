          <h2>Taking a bat to breast cancer one swing at a time!</h2>
        <p><img src="assets/Howa.jpg" class="howa right" /></p>
        <p>
          One of the greatest lessons and gifts I have learned is, life is not
          to be taken for granted! Live each day with no regrets and enjoy the
          sunshine, because none of us know what our future brings. Diagnosed
          with breast cancer on August 24, 2002. I under-went lumpectomy surgery
          on September 3rd, followed by six months of chemotherapy and three
          months of radiation treatments. This life changing series of events
          could have been devastating and often is; however, I chose not to let
          it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I coach volleyball and softball at the high school level and after my
          diagnosis, my athletes chose to wear pink ribbons with my name to
          every practice and game. They were committed to wearing them until I
          beat the cancer. My sixth graders begged to wear my wig and watching
          their reaction to a bald head relieved me of ever wearing it again.
          Their support meant the world to me and partially because of the kids,
          I missed only thirteen days of school through my surgery, 6 months of
          chemotherapy, and seven weeks of radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I vowed to do whatever I could to help in the battle against
          this number one cancer killer of women. In April of 2003, only eight
          months after my diagnosis and while still involved in chemotherapy and
          radiation treatments, I organized a “strike out cancer hit-a-thon” to
          raise money to donate to the Susan G. Komen Foundation Race for the
          Cure. The RHSM softball team rallied around me, as did three public
          schools in the state, and $12,000 was donated to the Foundation that
          first year. In the 2004 hit-a-thon, my efforts were to involve as many
          young people as possible in this endeavor, we involved students from
          seven public schools and were able to raise a total of $22,000 for
          breast cancer research. In 2005 & 2006, 20 more school softball teams
          joined the efforts and over $24,000 was again donated to the Komen
          Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for this project led to the establishment of what in 2007
          became known as “Swing for Life, Inc.”, a not for profit organization
          whose annual mission is to host fund-raising hit-a-thon events to
          raise money for breast cancer research, with 100% of the dollars
          raised donated to the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. Over 40 high school
          softball and baseball teams from public schools across Utah
          participated in 2007, raising $75,000, $10,000 of which went to the
          Wellness Center at the Huntsman Cancer Institute where cancer patients
          go to get their physical side back, the remainder donated to cancer
          research at Huntsman. This year’s event was just as successful, with
          hundreds of students from 45 public and private schools participating,
          all of them excited to be involved in this cause, proud to collect
          their pledges and submit their donations. Our grand total in the six
          years is $215,000 for breast cancer research!
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as I can, I will keep building this foundation until we find a
          cure. Every year we enlists more and more teams and sponsors who make
          monetary donations directly to Swing for Life or donate merchandise or
          gift certificates that I then uses as door prizes to help make the
          hit-a-thon event even more fun for the participants. I organize
          student volunteers who take on a myriad of jobs that need to be
          completed in order for the hit-a-thon to succeed. Determined to make
          the opening ceremonies of the Swing for Life event special, I also
          involve the local media, and have even been able to enlist the help of
          the Jazz Bear, Bumble the Bee, and Utah Grizzlies, Grizzbee at the
          event!
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the festivities on the day of the hit-a-thon, part of
          the weekend’s events includes a sleepover in our school’s gym for the
          softball teams, a question-answer discussion with the students
          regarding breast cancer and its detection and prevention, and a
          sharing of what the event means to each student via their shared
          comments. Two years ago, when I learned through these conversations
          that a softball player at a local high school had a mother who had
          recently passed away as a result of cancer, I returned the money that
          that team had raised during the hit-a-thon to the family of this
          student to help defray medical costs that had accrued as a result of
          her illness. It was a touching moment as the high school junior cried
          in my arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our efforts, this hit-a-thon concept continues to grow in
          strength state and nationwide, as it has spread to schools in
          Colorado, California and Arizona. I hooked up with Kristin Mort,
          current softball coach at Mesa State in Grand Junction, Colorado, this
          March and was the guest of honor when Mesa hosted a “Strike Out
          Cancer” game, all proceeds donated to the Swing for Life fund-raiser.
          In October, I dropped the puck at the Pink in the Rink at the
          Grizzlies hockey game as well as threw out the first pitch at the Salt
          Lake Bees 'Huntsman Breast Cancer Pink' baseball game in May 2008.

          It’s been 6 years and I have been blessed with good health and have
          kept the cancer from coming back. No matter how big Swing for Life
          becomes, I will always make sure 100% of the money goes to breast
          cancer research, we have a board of trustees that will never take a
          salary. I enjoy every minute I put into this and truly believe that my
          life has been changed for the better because of it. I can’t say enough
          about the kids or Swing for Life's Co-Founder, Kendra Tomsic, they
          have become soul mates on a mission and learn first-hand what it means
          to be involved in service for the greater good of others. I compare it
          to the movie ‘Pay it Forward’. If everyone did something special to
          make it better for someone else, we would eliminate a lot of terrible
          things in this world! These teams compete on the field but have
          learned more important lessons off the field with Swing for Life; how
          to make a difference in the community by giving back their time and
          efforts in finding a cure that could effect a family member, friend,
          or even themselves. My message to others that battle this ugly
          disease; don’t let the beast win! Most of us don’t have to, get in,
          detect early, and fight like a giant with the best of attitude. I
          think pink everyday! Nobody plans on getting this handed to them in
          their life but take these lemons and make “Pink Lemonade”!
